# TODO: Consider Pdb++ instead of ipdb

I'm not having any issues with ipdb (e.g. tab-completion works, interrogating object interfaces works, ...).  The only draw back is that configuring the console debugger can be tedious.  The
[repo for pdb++][pdbpp-rep] touts it as a drop-in replacement for pdb.

Spend some time checking it out.
