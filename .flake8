; E203 - Whitespace before ':'
; W503 - Line break before binary operator
; E501 - Line too long; With B9 enabled this is a duplicate of B950.  Disable it to avoid duplicate.
;        Unlike E501, from pycodestyle, B950 only triggers if max-line-length is exceeded by 10% or
;        more.  Inspired by Raymond Hettinger's "Beyond PEP8" talk.
